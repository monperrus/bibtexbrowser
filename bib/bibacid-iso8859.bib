  abstract = {An impressive linear influence of a magnetic field on optically generated
  trap-recharging waves (TRW) has been observed in InP:Fe and GaAs:Cr.
  The phenomenon appears for the particular orientation of (B) over
  right arrow parallel to the samples' surface and orthogonal to the
  direction of the electric field (E) over right arrow and wave vector
  of the TRW (K) over right arrow. The results are qualitatively explained
  taking into account the Lorentz force and a pronounced inhomogeneity
  of the charge transport and of the TRW parameters. },
