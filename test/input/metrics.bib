  abstract = {Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) is an approach to software development
	that uses models as primary artifacts, from which code, documentation
	and tests are derived. One way of assessing quality assurance in
	a given domain is to define domain metrics. As text documents, models
	can be considered from a syntactic point of view i.e., thought of
	as graphs. We can readily apply graph-based metrics to them, such
	as the number of nodes, the number of edges or the fan-in/fan-out
	distributions. However, these metrics cannot leverage the semantic
	structuring enforced by each specific metamodel to give domain specific
	information. Contrary to graph-based metrics, more specific metrics
	do exist for given domains (such as LOC for programs), but they lack
	genericity. Our contribution is to propose one metric that is generic
	over the domains and the metamodels and allows the easy specification
	of an open-ended wide range of model metrics.},
